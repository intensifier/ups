Ups is a X based source level debugger for the C, C++ and Fortran
programming languages.  It supports both run time debugging with breakpoints
and post-mortem debugging from a core file.  On Suns you can attach ups
to a running process. Ups runs in its own window, thus not interfering
with the target program's I/O.  The ups window has two major areas - one
showing a structured document representing the target state, the other
showing the source that is being executed.

Ups makes heavy use of direct manipulation and feedback.  When you add a
breakpoint it is shown as a pseudo C statement (#stop) in the source
display.  The current point of execution is highlighted in the source
display and you can watch it move as you step through loops and function
calls.  You can edit in fragments of interpreted C code (including
assignments to variables and calls to target functions).  There are powerful
facilities for exploring linked data structures - you can recursively
expand and collapse structures to follow links.
