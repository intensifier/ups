      * configure.in: The new option --enable_namestable
        switches build time to generate a runtime binary search
        in the dwarf_get_TAG_name() etc functions instead of the
        default switch statement (for the rare case one knows a
        compiler generates poor switch code).
      * configure: regenerated.
      * libdwarf.h: Correct format mistakes and omissions in
        the Dwarf_Regtable_Entry3_s comments.
        Add prototypes for dwarf_get_TAG_name() and the related
        new functions.
      * dwarf_frame.c: Add {} to clarify some 'if' ranges.
        Remove code updating the DW_FRAME_CFA_COL row when finishing
        up establishing the current frame table.  The code should never
        have been there. Fixed some indentation of function
        formal parameters.  Removed use of DW_FRAME_CFA_COL 
        and use de_frame_cfa_col_number instead.
        In dwarf_get_fde_info_for_reg (the older interface)
        correctly return the cfa table column in the 'old style'.
      * gennames.c: Copied from dwarfdump.c (with changes).
        This generates dwarf_names.c so that libdwarf has
        functions like dwarf_get_TAG_name() which returns
        the tag as a string (through a pointer argument).
      * dwarf.h: The first word of a comment is now capitalized (1 place).
      * common.c: New, used by gennames.c.
      * common.h: New, used by gennames.c
      * Makefile.in: Now contains changes which build and run
        gennames and create dwarf_names.o (which is part
        of libdwarf).
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document the new libdwarf functions.
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated as rev 1.76, 6 June 2009.
2009-06-05  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf.h: added new DWARF4 attribute (etc) defines.
2009-05-10  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_frame.c: Remove use of DW_FRAME_UNDEFINED_VAL in
        favor of the value in the dbg structure.
        Adding comments about the meaning of an error case.
2009-05-07  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * Makefile.in: Ensure temp files all get deleted.
2009-05-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_die_deliv.c: Update _dwarf_get_size_of_val() 
        call (with its new address_size argument).
      * dwarf_frame.c: Use the new ci_address_size instead
        of de_pointer_size.
      * dwarf_frame.h: Added  ci_address_size to cie
        in preparation for this value in DWARF4.
      * dwarf_util.h: Adding address_size functions
        and arguments declarations  so address_size can vary by CU.
      * dwarf_util.c: Adding address_size functions
        and arguments so address_size can vary by CU.
      * dwarf_loc.c: Adding function dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
        as a version with an address size argument.
      * dwarf_frame2.c: Now initializes new ci_address_size field.
      * dwarf_line.c: Now uses address size for CU instead of
        default de_pointer_size.
      * dwarf_ranges.c: File left out of svn before.
        Implements dwarf_get_ranges() and dwarf_get_ranges_a(),
        the latter is new with address size passed in via a DIE pointer.
      * dwarf_arange.c: Added commentary. Removed erroneous
        insistence that every aranges group have the same
        address_size as the main elf object.
      * dwarf_query.c: Adding address size to internal calls.
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Added '(file number is %d)' 
        to -l -v -v -v output as the
        file number and traditional C zero-origin index index of a 
        line table header are not the same value
        (see DWARF3 documentation, the end of section 6.2.5.3).
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a()
         and  dwarf_get_ranges_a().
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
      * libdwarf.h: Add commentary.
        Add   dwarf_loclist_from_expr_a() and
        dwarf_get_ranges_a() interfaces so address_size passed in.
2009-04-04  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h, dwarf_frame.c: Added dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value().
        Added dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value() as proper
        spelling of dwarf_set_frame_rule_inital_value(), keeping
        the old spelling for compatibility.
      * libdwarf2.1.mm: Documented Added dwarf_set_frame_cfa_value(),
        corrected spelling to dwarf_set_frame_rule_initial_value().
      * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerated.
      * dwarf_opaque.h: Added field de_frame_cfa_col_number so that
        we do not need to use magic macros at execution time.
      * dwarf_init_finish.c: Now sets de_frame_cfa_col_number,
        de_frame_same_value_number, and de_frame_undefined_value_number.
2009-02-02  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf.h: Added dwarf extensions reported by
        John Bishop.
2009-03-30  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf.h: Added dwarf extensions reported
        on the dwarf-workgroup mailing list by John DelSignore.
2009-03-19  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>

2009-02-17  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * dwarf_print_lines.c,dwarf_line.c,dwarf_frame.c: C99-isms
        of // comments and declarations-in-code do not belong in
	libdwarf.
2009-02-14  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Add support for compile-time definition
        of the format for Dwarf_Unsigned types.
        Using macros for DW_PR_DUx etc.
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Use the DW_PR_DUx macros.
      * configure.in: Define --enable-nonstandardprintf
      * config.h.in: new #undef HAVE_NONSTANDARD_PRINTF_64_FORMAT
      * configure: Regenerated.

2009-02-13  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Added argument to dwarf_print_lines()
        for better error reporting.  Added dwarf_check_lineheader()
	which allows some error reporting when not calling dwarf_print_lines().
      * dwarf_print_lines.c: Implements dwarf_check_lineheader() now.
      * dwarf_sort_line.c: Match up with new arguments to 
        dwarf_read_line_table_prefix().
      * dwarf_line.c: Implement new arguments to 
        dwarf_read_line_table_prefix() for better error reporting.
	Allow erroneous ARM-compiler line table header to be used.
      * dwarf_line.h: Adding new argument to dwarf_read_line_table_prefix
        so we can report back on minor errors in the line table prefix.
2009-01-31  DavidAnderson <davea42@earthlink.net>
      * libdwarf.h: Corrected  DW_DLE_LAST.
      * dwarf_frame.c: Remove accidental use of C99 mid-block
        variable definition.
