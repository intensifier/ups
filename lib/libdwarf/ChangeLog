     * libdwarf2p.1.mm: Now version 1.35.  Added a few words
       about the sect_name_index field in the callback
       from libdwarf to your code for each new Elf section
       to be generated.
     * libdwarf2p.1.pdf: Regenerated.
2014-02-02  David Anderson
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Added commentary.
     * dwarf_loc.c: Fixed two indents.
     * gennames.c: Removed trailing newlines from the printf
       output (dwarf_names_new.h is the file generated).
     * libdwarf.h.in: Removed trailing whitespace.
2014-02-01  David Anderson
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Instead of doing a long list of address compares,
       use the hash 'tree' and tfind() to determine if we malloced
       the space or simply took an address from .debug_info (
       or other in-memory section) when
       we returned a _dwarf_get_alloc() pointer to the user.
2014-01-31  David Anderson
     * configure.in: The test to generate HAVE___UINT32_T_IN_SYS_TYPES_H
       was in a strange place. Moved it up a few lines.
     * configure: Regenerated.
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Added comment hinting at how dwarf_dealloc
       can be further simplified.
2014-01-30  David Anderson
     * dwarf_loc.c: Add support for DW_FORM_exprloc
       to dwarf_loclist_n().
     * libdwarf2.1.mm: Document support for DW_FORM_exprloc.Version 2.16
     * libdwarf2.1.pdf: Regenerate.
     * dwarf.h, dwarf_form.c, dwarf_line.c,
       dwarf_query.c, dwarf_util.c: Add limited support for DW_FORM_GNU_ref_alt
        and DW_FORM_GNU_strp_alt.
2014-01-30  David Anderson
     * dwarf_alloc.c: Refactored and added relevant commentary.
       Added a check for debug_types in dwarf_dealloc().
     * dwarf_init_finish.c: Corrected a comment and made one line
       declation-is-initialization.
     * dwarf_opaque.h: Added commentary.

       Remove trailing whitespace.
2014-01-29  David Anderson
     *  dwarf_tsearch.h, dwarf_tsearchhash.c: New files implementing
        a hashed tree with tsearch() interfaces.
     *  Makefile.in: Add dwarf_tsearchhash.c to the build.
     *  dwarf_init_finish.c: Remove references to malloc_check and _dwarf_setup_debug()
        and include of "malloc_check.h" as those are no longer needed.
     *  dwarf_line.c: Removed a superfluous _dwarf_get_alloc().  The result of the call
        was never used.
     *  dwarf_opaque.h: Removed Dwarf_Alloc_Hdr_s references and simple malloc references.
        added de_alloc_tree as base of a hash database replacing most of dwarf_alloc.c.
     *  dwarf_query.c: Removed an unused local variable.
     *  dwarf_alloc.h,dwarf_alloc.c: Removed simple malloc support and all the 
        complicated code handling allocation record-keeping in favor of 
        much simpler code calling functions
        using a tsearch-like interface.
2014-01-10  David Anderson
     *  dwarf_print_lines.c,dwarf_macro.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_ranges.c, dwarf_sort_lines.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_query.c, dwarf_pubtypes.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  dwarf_original_elf_init.c,dwarf_loc.c: Remove trailing whitespace.
     *  gennames.c: Fix a printf so the generated dwarf_names.c
        does not have a trailing space.
2014-01-10  David Anderson
     *	gennames.c: Added comment clarifying why error is set
        before the call to fgets, and fixing the declaration
        order to avoid c99-ism.
     *  dwarf_frame2.c: Use /* not // for comments in C.
